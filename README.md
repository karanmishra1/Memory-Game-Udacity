# Udacity Memory Game

## Project Purpose :

This was built in my FEND nanodegree program at Udacity. The purpose was to use HTML, CSS and vanilla jascript to build a memory game.

### How to Play?

- The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.


- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
- If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Dependencies

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- Congratulations Modal made using sweetalert https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/#upgrading-from-1x

### Please note

There is an issue with the congratulations modal. When the user wins the moves reflects one less and number of star also reflects incorrectly if the star has just changed (for example if the star falls on the 20th move from 2 to 1 star it will show 2 stars in the modal). If someone can fix this it will be great :)

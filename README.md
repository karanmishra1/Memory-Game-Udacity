# Udacity Memory Game

## Project Purpose :

This was built in my FEND nanodegree program at Udacity. The purpose was to use HTML, CSS and vanilla jascript to build a memory game.

### How to Play?

- The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.


- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
- If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
